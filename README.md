# 🚗☁️ The Potential of Integrating AI and Cloud in Autonomous Systems

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the integration of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance autonomous systems with a special focus on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication  
It proposes a cloud-assisted architecture leveraging AWS services, Edge Computing, MQTT protocols, and AI/ML pipelines** to improve perception, decision-making, and real-time responsiveness in autonomous vehicles.

The work was developed as part of a seminar project at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Investigate synergies between AI and Cloud in autonomous driving.
- Design a V2X-enabled cloud architecture for connected vehicles.
- Explore edge computing for low-latency decision-making.
- Integrate AI/ML model training & inference** using cloud services.
- Assess scalability, security, and real-time performance.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
The proposed architecture combines:
- Edge Computing Nodes → Real-time data processing near the vehicle.
- Cloud Backend (AWS) → Scalable data storage, training, and global communication.
- MQTT Broker → Efficient, lightweight messaging for V2X communication.
- AI/ML Pipeline → Model training and deployment using AWS SageMaker.
